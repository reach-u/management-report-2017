## Reach-U Management Report 2017

## Q: Is this really an official management report?

Indeed it is. All Estonian private companies have a legal obligation to make their annual reports public. A typical management report contains 1-2 pages of text containing information about finance, management, customers and projects. But we have decided to choose a slightly different road. The first year we created our somewhat unusual management report, we were a little worried - would the Commercial Register accept it? But they gave their seal of approval and everything was formal! We are grateful to the officials for that! 

## Q: On what grounds is this a suitable management report?

The Accounting Act lists the items that must be in the management report (Accounting Act https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/530102013006/consolide § 24. Management report). We read the Act carefully and documented everything meticulously. We included all required information and added even more - important events and activities for us.
The official management report is in Estonian as that is the Commercial Register's requirement but English version is also available.

## Q: Why Javasript code?

Across three decades Reach-U evolved from map maker to GIS solutions provider and developer of complex software, with customers around the world. In the first management reports we combined the skills of cartographs and software engineers, demonstrating the power of maps by rendering our management report in the form of one. When entering a new business area – city planning – the important step also reflected in our management reports, taking the form of a subway map.

This year we switched gears – the management report is not text, but fully functional JavaScript code. This again demonstrates our vision – when working in an agile manner and delivering builds on a daily basis, communication must be so good that even the code must be readable as plain English.
